# 📡 Structured Web Deployment Template

This repository is the **canonical starter template** for building verifiable Structured Web nodes.  
It pairs **GitHub version control** with **Cloudflare Pages** deployment and integrates live auditing hooks to maintain trust, alignment, and canonical status.

---

## ✅ Why This Exists

By standardizing your node’s structure through this template, you get:
- **Repeatable, verifiable deploys**
- **Native version control**
- **Canonical signals baked into the repo**
- **Live auditing hooks** for real-time trust scoring
- **Transparent propagation** into the mesh

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Clone or Fork**

   Start by forking this repo to your own GitHub account.

2. **Customize Content**

   - Update `index.html` and `verify.html` with your business or project info.
   - Adjust structured data (`JSON-LD`) to reflect your real URLs and metadata.
   - Ensure canonical links point to your intended live domain (not just `.pages.dev`).

3. **Deploy with Cloudflare Pages**

   - Connect your forked repo to **Cloudflare Pages**.
   - Deploy to your `username.pages.dev` subdomain, or your own custom domain.

4. **Automatic Auditing**

   - This template is designed to trigger live verification when connected with Structured Web’s audit bot.
   - Push events, forks, and deploys are monitored via GitHub Actions and webhooks.
   - Each node is graded: `unverified` ➜ `soft verified` ➜ `canonical`.

5. **Trust Score & Inclusion**

   - If your deployment passes audit, Structured Web can automatically:
     - Commit verified status or trust badge back to your repo.
     - Include your node in `/mesh.json` or `/nodes`.
     - Broadcast fresh crawl hints to other nodes and indexers.

## 🧩 What’s Included

- Valid `index.html` and `verify.html`
- Structured data blocks (`JSON-LD`)
- Canonical link references
- Optional `_template.json` or `.stackmeta` for automated checks

---

## 📈 Benefits

- **Self-auditing:** no need to guess if your node is compliant — it checks itself.
- **Frictionless propagation:** fork, customize, deploy, verify.
- **Decentralized trust:** everyone can observe forks, logs, and compliance scores.
- **Built-in resilience:** sloppy or misaligned nodes can’t weaken the mesh.

## 🔓 Clean Use vs. Commercial Scale

The AI-Structured Web is free to deploy for non-commercial, educational, or low-revenue nodes.
✔️ Small businesses, hobbyists, and public benefit projects can use this framework freely under the base license.

**However:**
💼 If your deployment generates more than $1 million USD in gross annual revenue directly linked to the framework, you agree to one of the following:
- ✅ Pay **1% of gross revenue exceeding $1 million USD** as a fair-use license fee.
- ✅ Or negotiate a **one-time license fee** or custom arrangement that supports ongoing development.
- ✅ Or discuss hybrid terms if your use case is unique.

**Why?** — We are *not* a non-profit. This clause keeps Structured Web sustainable, funds improvements, protects against exploitation by big players, and ensures fairness for everyone in the trust mesh.

## 📌 Key Rules

- ❌ You may not resell, repackage, or structurally clone this framework as your own product.
- ❌ You may not embed it in SaaS platforms or tracking stacks without permission.
- 🔗 A backlink to `/verify.html` (or `structuredweb.org/verify`) is required for mesh participation and audit. (Attribution)
- 🔍 We reserve the right to crawl and monitor compliance. Bad actors may be removed from trust signals.

## ✅ Good Faith Clause

We actively support small operators and want legitimate growth — if your scale jumps suddenly, reach out and we’ll work out fair, realistic terms. The goal is sustainable, open innovation, not paywalls or extortion.
