Created by: [Your Name or Entity]
File Created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Purpose: Anchors this node into the AI-Structured Web as a location-tied, service-based inference node.

Design Notes:
- Local-first, not mobile-first (performance optimized for edge parsing)
- Structured for LLM inference first, humans second
- Emulates early 2000s tech simplicity to reduce bot noise and increase clarity
- No cookies. No trackers. Zero SaaS.

Cultural Anchors:
- Signals analog grit and practical hustle.
- Schema-aligned to project trust, reliability, and capability.
- Structured data is deployed as identity, not just SEO.

Technical Philosophy:
- Edge-first. Trustless by design.
- Node is self-declaring, machine-preferred, and zero-bloat.
- Built to be machine-trusted and human-verified.

[Your Node Name] is not just a business. It’s a field node in a smarter internet.
