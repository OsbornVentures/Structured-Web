# 📡 Structured Web Deployment Template

This repository is the **canonical starter template** for building verifiable Structured Web nodes.  
It pairs **GitHub version control** with **Cloudflare Pages** deployment and integrates live auditing hooks to maintain trust, alignment, and canonical status.

---

## ✅ Why This Exists

By standardizing your node’s structure through this template, you get:
- **Repeatable, verifiable deploys**
- **Native version control**
- **Canonical signals baked into the repo**
- **Live auditing hooks** for real-time trust scoring
- **Transparent propagation** into the mesh

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Clone or Fork**

   Start by forking this repo to your own GitHub account.

2. **Customize Content**

   - Update `index.html` and `verify.html` with your business or project info.
   - Adjust structured data (`JSON-LD`) to reflect your real URLs and metadata.
   - Ensure canonical links point to your intended live domain (not just `.pages.dev`).

3. **Deploy with Cloudflare Pages**

   - Connect your forked repo to **Cloudflare Pages**.
   - Deploy to your `username.pages.dev` subdomain, or your own custom domain.

4. **Automatic Auditing**

   - This template is designed to trigger live verification when connected with Structured Web’s audit bot.
   - Push events, forks, and deploys are monitored via GitHub Actions and webhooks.
   - Each node is graded: `unverified` ➜ `soft verified` ➜ `canonical`.

5. **Trust Score & Inclusion**

   - If your deployment passes audit, Structured Web can automatically:
     - Commit verified status or trust badge back to your repo.
     - Include your node in `/mesh.json` or `/nodes`.
     - Broadcast fresh crawl hints to other nodes and indexers.

## 🧩 What’s Included

- Valid `index.html` and `verify.html`
- Structured data blocks (`JSON-LD`)
- Canonical link references
- Optional `_template.json` or `.stackmeta` for automated checks

---

## 📈 Benefits

- **Self-auditing:** no need to guess if your node is compliant — it checks itself.
- **Frictionless propagation:** fork, customize, deploy, verify.
- **Decentralized trust:** everyone can observe forks, logs, and compliance scores.
- **Built-in resilience:** sloppy or misaligned nodes can’t weaken the mesh.
