  // ✅ assistant_context.json — Step 3 in the Structured Web Workflow
  // -------------------------------------------------------------
  // Purpose:
  //   - This file is your node’s explicit assistant-facing context.
  //   - It gives LLMs, agents, and inference crawlers the nuance,
  //     tone, policy, and real-world details beyond your raw schema.
  //
  // Why this matters:
  //   - Google or other engines may not *index* this directly today,
  //     but they absolutely parse and store it for model alignment.
  //
  // Crawler behavior:
  //   - Crawl allowed? ✅
  //   - Page fetch? ✅
  //   - Indexing? May show “N/A” in Google, but it is *always* parsed.
  //
  // Best practice:
  //   - Mirror the substance in your HTML and JSON-LD.
  //   - Don’t fill it with fluff or disconnected hype — speak plainly,
  //     like a real operator explaining real operations.
  //   - Use FAQ pages, reviews, and human nav to hold your longtail.
  //   - It’s your *real SEO* in a Structured Web world — human-readable,
  //     machine-preferred, aligned with your schema. 
  //     consistant manipulation in semantic alignment degrades trust.
  //     Want to experiment with search results? Do it carefully — always set your sitemap priorities correctly to preserve trust. 
  //     Make sure your sitemap priority is set correctly to maintain trust,
  //     this is part of inference and intent as well, so be sure to keep it in mind.
  //     Metrics like this are your new SEO. The better the order, the better the trust score.
  //     
  //
  // Semantic alignment:
  //   - Our audit checks for keyword and concept overlap between your
  //     pages and JSON-LD.
  //   - A single page may score only ~50% on its own — but your full
  //     node should stay ~90%+ overall.
  //   - Miss the bar? Our audit bot may raise a public pull request or
  //     open an issue on your GitHub fork.
  //
  // Workflow placement:
  //   robots.txt ➜ manifest.json ➜ ai.json ➜ assistant_context.json ➜ verify.json ➜ verify.html
