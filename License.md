## 🔓 Clean Use vs. Commercial Scale

The AI-Structured Web is free to deploy for non-commercial, educational, or low-revenue nodes.
✔️ Small businesses, hobbyists, and public benefit projects can use this framework freely under the base license.

**However:**
💼 If your deployment generates more than $1 million USD in gross annual revenue directly linked to the framework, you agree to one of the following:
- ✅ Pay **1% of gross revenue exceeding $1 million USD** as a fair-use license fee.
- ✅ Or negotiate a **one-time license fee** or custom arrangement that supports ongoing development.
- ✅ Or discuss hybrid terms if your use case is unique.

**Why?** — We are *not* a non-profit. This clause keeps Structured Web sustainable, funds improvements, protects against exploitation by big players, and ensures fairness for everyone in the trust mesh.

## 📌 Key Rules

- ❌ You may not resell, repackage, or structurally clone this framework as your own product.
- ❌ You may not embed it in SaaS platforms or tracking stacks without permission.
- 🔗 A backlink to `/verify.html` (or `structuredweb.org/verify`) is required for mesh participation and audit. (Attribution)
- 🔍 We reserve the right to crawl and monitor compliance. Bad actors may be removed from trust signals.

## ✅ Good Faith Clause

We actively support small operators and want legitimate growth — if your scale jumps suddenly, reach out and we’ll work out fair, realistic terms. The goal is sustainable, open innovation, not paywalls or extortion.
